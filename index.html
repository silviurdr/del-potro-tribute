                    <p>Juan Martin del Potro, a 20 year-old from Argentina, won his first grand slam title by coming
                        back from two sets to one down for a five-set victory over Roger Federer in the US Open final.
                        Del Potro's success in 2009 also ended Federer's five-year winning streak at the US Open.

                    <p>Juan Martins' forehand earned him a nickname “Del Thortro” from Roger Federer, referring to the
                        superhero
                        Thor. “It was funny to watch. Every player was talking about my forehand and my new nickname on
                        tour. Then I got a couple of hammers on the tour. I like this new nickname on me and still
                        working hard on my forehands.”

                    <p>Juan Martin del Potro was brought to tears after an incredible show of support from fans during
                        his US Open quarter-final against Stan Wawrinka. As del Potro went out for the last game, the
                        fans that had remained as the clock moved past 1:00am serenaded him and the big Argentine wiped
                        away tears as "Ole, ole, ole, ole, Delpo, Delpo," rained down from the Arthur Ashe Stadium
                        stands.
